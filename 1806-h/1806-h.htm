    <p>
      When the voice over the telephone promised to name the man who killed
      Hermann Banf, District Attorney Wharton was up-town lunching at
      Delmonico&rsquo;s. This was contrary to his custom and a concession to Hamilton
      Cutler, his distinguished brother-in-law. That gentleman was interested in
      a State constabulary bill and had asked State Senator Bissell to father
      it. He had suggested to the senator that, in the legal points involved in
      the bill, his brother-in-law would undoubtedly be charmed to advise him.
      So that morning, to talk it over, Bissell had come from Albany and, as he
      was forced to return the same afternoon, had asked Wharton to lunch with
      him up-town near the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      That in public life there breathed a man with soul so dead who, were he
      offered a chance to serve Hamilton Cutler, would not jump at the chance
      was outside the experience of the county chairman. And in so judging his
      fellow men, with the exception of one man, the senator was right. The one
      man was Hamilton Cutler&rsquo;s brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the national affairs of his party Hamilton Cutler was one of the four
      leaders. In two cabinets he had held office. At a foreign court as an
      ambassador his dinners, of which the diplomatic corps still spoke with
      emotion, had upheld the dignity of ninety million Americans. He was rich.
      The history of his family was the history of the State. When the Albany
      boats drew abreast of the old Cutler mansion on the cast bank of the
      Hudson the passengers pointed at it with deference. Even when the search
      lights pointed at it, it was with deference. And on Fifth Avenue, as the
      &ldquo;Seeing New York&rdquo; car passed his town house it slowed respectfully to half
      speed. When, apparently for no other reason than that she was good and
      beautiful, he had married the sister of a then unknown up State lawyer,
      every one felt Hamilton Cutler had made his first mistake. But, like every
      thing else into which he entered, for him matrimony also was a success.
      The prettiest girl in Utica showed herself worthy of her distinguished
      husband. She had given him children as beautiful as herself; as what
      Washington calls &ldquo;a cabinet lady&rdquo; she had kept her name out of the
      newspapers; as Madame L&rsquo;Ambassatrice she had put archduchesses at their
      ease; and after ten years she was an adoring wife, a devoted mother, and a
      proud woman. Her pride was in believing that for every joy she knew she
      was indebted entirely to her husband. To owe everything to him, to feel
      that through him the blessings flowed, was her ideal of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this ideal her brother did not share. Her delight in a sense of
      obligation left him quite cold. No one better than himself knew that his
      rapid-fire rise in public favor was due to his own exertions, to the fact
      that he had worked very hard, had been independent, had kept his hands
      clean, and had worn no man&rsquo;s collar. Other people believed he owed his
      advancement to his brother-in-law. He knew they believed that, and it hurt
      him. When, at the annual dinner of the Amen Corner, they burlesqued him as
      singing to &ldquo;Ham&rdquo; Cutler, &ldquo;You made me what I am to-day, I hope you&rsquo;re
      satisfied,&rdquo; he found that to laugh with the others was something of an
      effort. His was a difficult position. He was a party man; he had always
      worked inside the organization. The fact that whenever he ran for an
      elective office the reformers indorsed him and the best elements in the
      opposition parties voted for him did not shake his loyalty to his own
      people. And to Hamilton Cutler, as one of his party leaders, as one of the
      bosses of the &ldquo;invisible government,&rdquo; he was willing to defer. But while
      he could give allegiance to his party leaders, and from them was willing
      to receive the rewards of office, from a rich brother-in-law he was not at
      all willing to accept anything. Still less was he willing that of the
      credit he deserved for years of hard work for the party, of self-denial,
      and of efficient public service the rich brother-in-law, should rob him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pride was to be known as a self-made man, as the servant only of the
      voters. And now that ambition, now that he was district attorney of New
      York City, to have it said that the office was the gift of his
      brother-in-law was bitter. But he believed the injustice would soon end.
      In a month he was coming up for re-election, and night and day was
      conducting a campaign that he hoped would result in a personal victory so
      complete as to banish the shadow of his brother-in-law. Were he re-elected
      by the majority on which he counted, he would have the party leaders on
      their knees. Hamilton Cutler would be forced to come to him. He would be
      in line for promotion. He knew the leaders did not want to promote him,
      that they considered him too inclined to kick over the traces; but were he
      now re-elected, at the next election, either for mayor or governor, he
      would be his party&rsquo;s obvious and legitimate candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The re-election was not to be an easy victory. Outside his own party, to
      prevent his succeeding himself as district attorney, Tammany Hall was
      using every weapon in her armory. The commissioner of police was a Tammany
      man, and in the public prints Wharton had repeatedly declared that Banf,
      his star witness against the police, had been killed by the police, and
      that they had prevented the discovery of his murderer. For this the wigwam
      wanted his scalp, and to get it had raked his public and private life, had
      used threats and bribes, and with women had tried to trap him into a
      scandal. But &ldquo;Big Tim&rdquo; Meehan, the lieutenant the Hall had detailed to
      destroy Wharton, had reported back that for their purpose his record was
      useless, that bribes and threats only flattered him, and that the traps
      set for him he had smilingly side-stepped. This was the situation a month
      before election day when, to oblige his brother-in-law, Wharton was
      up-town at Delmonico&rsquo;s lunching with Senator Bissell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down-town at the office, Rumson, the assistant district attorney, was on
      his way to lunch when the telephone-girl halted him. Her voice was lowered
      and betrayed almost human interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the corner of her mouth she whispered: &ldquo;This man has a note for Mr.
      Wharton&mdash;says if he don&rsquo;t get it quick it&rsquo;ll be too late&mdash;says
      it will tell him who killed &lsquo;Heimie&rsquo; Banf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man and the girl looked at each other and smiled. Their
      experience had not tended to make them credulous. Had he lived, Hermann
      Banf would have been, for Wharton, the star witness against a ring of
      corrupt police officials. In consequence his murder was more than the
      taking off of a shady and disreputable citizen. It was a blow struck at
      the high office of the district attorney, at the grand jury, and the law.
      But, so far, whoever struck the blow had escaped punishment, and though
      for a month, ceaselessly, by night and day &ldquo;the office&rdquo; and the police had
      sought him, he was still at large, still &ldquo;unknown.&rdquo; There had been
      hundreds of clews. They had been furnished by the detectives of the city
      and county and of the private agencies, by amateurs, by news-papers, by
      members of the underworld with a score to pay off or to gain favor. But no
      clew had led anywhere. When, in hoarse whispers, the last one had been
      confided to him by his detectives, Wharton had protested indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop bringing me clews!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I want the man. I can&rsquo;t
      electrocute a clew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So when, after all other efforts, over the telephone a strange voice
      offered to deliver the murderer, Rumson was skeptical. He motioned the
      girl to switch to the desk telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assistant District Attorney Rumson speaking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can I do for
      you?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the answer came, as though the speaker were choosing his words,
      there was a pause. It lasted so long that Rumson exclaimed sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Do you want to speak to me, or do you want to speak
      to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotta letter for the district attorney,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to
      give it to nobody but him. It&rsquo;s about Banf. He must get it quick, or it&rsquo;ll
      be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Rumson. &ldquo;Where are you speaking from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man at the other end of the wire ignored the questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll Wharton be for the next twenty minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I tell you,&rdquo; parried Rumson, &ldquo;will you bring the letter at once?&rdquo; The
      voice exclaimed indignantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring nothing! I&rsquo;ll send it by district messenger. You&rsquo;re wasting time
      trying to reach me. It&rsquo;s the LETTER you want. It tells&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the
      voice broke with an oath and instantly began again: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk over a
      phone. I tell you, it&rsquo;s life or death. If you lose out, it&rsquo;s your own
      fault. Where can I find Wharton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Delmonico&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Rumson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be there until two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Delmonico&rsquo;s! That&rsquo;s Forty-fort Street?&rdquo; &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Rumson. &ldquo;Tell the
      messenger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He heard the receiver slam upon the hook. With
      the light of the hunter in his eyes, he turned to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can laugh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but I believe we&rsquo;ve hooked something. I&rsquo;m
      going after it.&rdquo; In the waiting-room he found the detectives. &ldquo;Hewitt,&rdquo; he
      ordered, &ldquo;take the subway and whip up to Delmonico&rsquo;s. Talk to the
      taxi-starter till a messenger-boy brings a letter for the D. A. Let the
      boy deliver the note, and then trail him till he reports to the man he got
      it from. Bring the man here. If it&rsquo;s a district messenger and he doesn&rsquo;t
      report, but goes straight back to the office, find out who gave him the
      note; get his description. Then meet me at Delmonico&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rumson called up that restaurant and had Wharton come to the phone. He
      asked his chief to wait until a letter he believed to be of great
      importance was delivered to him. He explained, but, of necessity, somewhat
      sketchily. &ldquo;It sounds to me,&rdquo; commented his chief, &ldquo;like a plot of yours
      to get a lunch up-town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invitation!&rdquo; cried Rumson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Rumson had joined Wharton and Bissell the note arrived. It was
      brought to the restaurant by a messenger-boy, who said that in answer to a
      call from a saloon on Sixth Avenue he had received it from a young man in
      ready-to-wear clothes and a green hat. When Hewitt, the detective, asked
      what the young man looked like, the boy said he looked like a young man in
      ready-to-wear clothes and a green hat. But when the note was read the
      identity of the man who delivered it ceased to be of importance. The paper
      on which it was written was without stamped address or monogram, and
      carried with it the mixed odors of the drug-store at which it had been
      purchased. The handwriting was that of a woman, and what she had written
      was: &ldquo;If the district attorney will come at once, and alone, to Kessler&rsquo;s
      Cafe, on the Boston Post Road, near the city line, he will be told who
      killed Hermann Banf. If he don&rsquo;t come in an hour, it will be too late. If
      he brings anybody with him, he won&rsquo;t be told anything. Leave your car in
      the road and walk up the drive. Ida Earle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hewitt, who had sent away the messenger-boy and had been called in to give
      expert advice, was enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. District Attorney,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s no crank letter. This Earle
      woman is wise. You got to take her as a serious proposition. She wouldn&rsquo;t
      make that play if she couldn&rsquo;t get away with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the police, the detective assured them, Ida Earle had been known for
      years. When she was young she had been under the protection of a man high
      in the ranks of Tammany, and, in consequence, with her different ventures
      the Police had never interfered. She now was proprietress of the
      road-house in the note described as Kessler&rsquo;s Cafe. It was a place for
      joy-riders. There was a cabaret, a hall for public dancing, and rooms for
      very private suppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In so far as it welcomed only those who could spend money it was
      exclusive, but in all other respects its reputation was of the worst. In
      situation it was lonely, and from other houses separated by a quarter of a
      mile of dying trees and vacant lots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boston Post Road upon which it faced was the old post road, but
      lately, through this back yard and dumping-ground of the city, had been
      relaid. It was patrolled only and infrequently by bicycle policemen. &ldquo;But
      this,&rdquo; continued the detective eagerly, &ldquo;is where we win out. The
      road-house is an old farmhouse built over, with the barns changed into
      garages. They stand on the edge of a wood. It&rsquo;s about as big as a city
      block. If we come in through the woods from the rear, the garages will
      hide us. Nobody in the house can see us, but we won&rsquo;t be a hundred yards
      away. You&rsquo;ve only to blow a police whistle and we&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean I ought to go?&rdquo; said Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumson exclaimed incredulously: &ldquo;You got to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; objected Bissell, &ldquo;like a plot to get you there alone
      and rap you on the head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not with that note inviting him there,&rdquo;
       protested Hewitt, &ldquo;and signed by Earle herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know she signed it?&rdquo; objected the senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know her,&rdquo; returned the detective. &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s no fool. It&rsquo;s her
      place, and she wouldn&rsquo;t let them pull off any rough stuff there&mdash;not
      against the D. A. anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The D. A. was rereading the note. &ldquo;Might this be it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Suppose
      it&rsquo;s a trick to mix me up in a scandal? You say the place is disreputable.
      Suppose they&rsquo;re planning to compromise me just before election. They&rsquo;ve
      tried it already several times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve still got the note,&rdquo; persisted Hewitt. &ldquo;It proves why you went
      there. And the senator, too. He can testify. And we won&rsquo;t be hundred yards
      away. And,&rdquo; he added grudgingly, &ldquo;you have Nolan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nolan was the spoiled child of &lsquo;the office.&rsquo; He was the district
      attorney&rsquo;s pet. Although still young, he had scored as a detective and as
      a driver of racing-cars. As Wharton&rsquo;s chauffeur he now doubled the parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Nolan testified wouldn&rsquo;t be any help,&rdquo; said Wharton. &ldquo;They would say
      it was just a story he invented to save me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then square yourself this way,&rdquo; urged Rumson. &ldquo;Send a note now by hand to
      Ham Cutler and one to your sister. Tell them you&rsquo;re going to Ida Earle&rsquo;s&mdash;and
      why&mdash;tell them you&rsquo;re afraid it&rsquo;s a frame-up, and for them to keep
      your notes as evidence. And enclose the one from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wharton nodded in approval, and, while he wrote, Rumson and the detective
      planned how, without those inside the road-house being aware of their
      presence, they might be near it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kessler&rsquo;s Cafe lay in the Seventy-ninth Police Precinct. In taxi-cabs they
      arranged to start at once and proceed down White Plains Avenue, which
      parallels the Boston Road, until they were on a line with Kessler&rsquo;s, but
      from it hidden by the woods and the garages. A walk of a quarter of a mile
      across lots and under cover of the trees would bring them to within a
      hundred yards of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wharton was to give them a start of half an hour. That he might know they
      were on watch, they agreed, after they dismissed the taxi-cabs, to send
      one of them into the Boston Post Road past the road-house. When it was
      directly in front of the cafe, the chauffeur would throw away into the
      road an empty cigarette-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the cigar-stand they selected a cigarette box of a startling yellow.
      At half a mile it was conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you see this in the road,&rdquo; explained Rumson, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re on
      the job. And after you&rsquo;re inside, if you need us, you&rsquo;ve only to go to a
      rear window and wave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they mean to do him up,&rdquo; growled Bissell, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t get to a rear
      window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can always tell them we&rsquo;re outside,&rdquo; said Rumson&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;and
      they are extremely likely to believe him. Do you want a gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the D. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better have mine,&rdquo;&rsquo; urged Hewitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my own,&rdquo; explained the D. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumson and Hewitt set off in taxi-cabs and, a half-hour later, Wharton
      followed. As he sank back against the cushions of the big touring-car he
      felt a pleasing thrill of excitement, and as he passed the traffic police,
      and they saluted mechanically, he smiled. Had they guessed his errand
      their interest in his progress would have been less perfunctory. In half
      an hour he might know that the police killed Banf; in half an hour he
      himself might walk into a trap they had, in turn, staged for him. As the
      car ran swiftly through the clean October air, and the wind and sun
      alternately chilled and warmed his blood, Wharton considered these
      possibilities.
    </p>

      He could not believe the woman Earle would lend herself to any plot to do
      him bodily harm. She was a responsible person. In her own world she was as
      important a figure as was the district attorney in his. Her allies were
      the man &ldquo;higher up&rdquo; in Tammany and the police of the upper ranks of the
      uniformed force. And of the higher office of the district attorney she
      possessed an intimate and respectful knowledge. It was not to be
      considered that against the prosecuting attorney such a woman would wage
      war. So the thought that upon his person any assault was meditated Wharton
      dismissed as unintelligent. That it was upon his reputation the attack was
      planned seemed much more probable. But that contingency he had foreseen
      and so, he believed, forestalled. There then remained only the possibility
      that the offer in the letter was genuine. It seemed quite too good to be
      true. For, as he asked himself, on the very eve of an election, why should
      Tammany, or a friend of Tammany, place in his possession the information
      that to the Tammany candidate would bring inevitable defeat. He felt that
      the way they were playing into his hands was too open, too generous. If
      their object was to lead him into a trap, of all baits they might use the
      promise to tell him who killed Banf was the one certain to attract him. It
      made their invitation to walk into the parlor almost too obvious. But were
      the offer not genuine, there was a condition attached to it that puzzled
      him. It was not the condition that stipulated he should come alone. His
      experience had taught him many will confess, or betray, to the district
      attorney who, to a deputy, will tell nothing. The condition that puzzled
      him was the one that insisted he should come at once or it would be &ldquo;too
      late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why was haste so imperative? Why, if he delayed, would he be &ldquo;too late&rdquo;?
      Was the man he sought about to escape from his jurisdiction, was he dying,
      and was it his wish to make a death-bed confession; or was he so reluctant
      to speak that delay might cause him to reconsider and remain silent?
    </p>
    <p>
      With these questions in his mind, the minutes quickly passed, and it was
      with a thrill of excitement Wharton saw that Nolan had left the Zoological
      Gardens on the right and turned into the Boston Road. It had but lately
      been completed and to Wharton was unfamiliar. On either side of the
      unscarred roadway still lay scattered the uprooted trees and boulders that
      had blocked its progress, and abandoned by the contractors were empty
      tar-barrels, cement-sacks, tool-sheds, and forges. Nor was the surrounding
      landscape less raw and unlovely. Toward the Sound stretched vacant lots
      covered with ash heaps; to the left a few old and broken houses set among
      the glass-covered cold frames of truck-farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The district attorney felt a sudden twinge of loneliness. And when an
      automobile sign told him he was &ldquo;10 miles from Columbus Circle,&rdquo; he felt
      that from the New York he knew he was much farther. Two miles up the road
      his car overhauled a bicycle policeman, and Wharton halted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a road-house called Kessler&rsquo;s beyond here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the left, farther up,&rdquo; the officer told him, and added: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
      miss it Mr. Wharton; there&rsquo;s no other house near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me,&rdquo; said the D.A. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll understand what I want you to
      do. I&rsquo;ve agreed to go to that house alone. If they see you pass they may
      think I&rsquo;m not playing fair. So stop here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded and dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; added the district attorney, as the car started forward again, &ldquo;If
      you hear shots, I don&rsquo;t care how fast you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better let me trail along now,&rdquo; he called; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a tough joint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Wharton motioned him back; and when again he turned to look the man
      still stood where they had parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later an empty taxi-cab came swiftly toward him and, as it
      passed, the driver lifted his hand from the wheel, and with his thumb
      motioned behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the men,&rdquo; said Nolan, &ldquo;that started with Mr. Rumson and
      Hewitt from Delmonico&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wharton nodded; and, now assured that in their plan there had been no
      hitch, smiled with satisfaction. A moment later, when ahead of them on the
      asphalt road Nolan pointed out a spot of yellow, he recognized the signal
      and knew that within call were friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow cigarette-box lay directly in front of a long wooden building
      of two stories. It was linked to the road by a curving driveway marked on
      either side by whitewashed stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      On verandas enclosed In glass Wharton saw white-covered tables under red
      candle-shade and, protruding from one end of the house and hung with
      electric lights in paper lanterns, a pavilion for dancing. In the rear of
      the house stood sheds and a thick tangle of trees on which the autumn
      leaves showed yellow painted fingers and arrows pointing, and an electric
      sign, proclaimed to all who passed that this was Kessler&rsquo;s. In spite of
      its reputation, the house wore the aspect of the commonplace. In evidence
      nothing flaunted, nothing threatened From a dozen other inns along the
      Pelham Parkway and the Boston Post Road it was no way to be distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      As directed in the note, Wharton left the car in the road. &ldquo;For five
      minutes stay where you are,&rdquo; he ordered Nolan; &ldquo;then go to the bar and get
      a drink. Don&rsquo;t talk to any one or they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re trying to get
      information. Work around to the back of the house. Stand where I can see
      you from the window. I may want you to carry a message to Mr. Rumson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On foot Wharton walked up the curved drive-way, and if from the house his
      approach was spied upon, there was no evidence. In the second story the
      blinds were drawn and on the first floor the verandas were empty. Nor, not
      even after he had mounted to the veranda and stepped inside the house, was
      there any sign that his visit was expected. He stood in a hall, and in
      front of him rose a broad flight of stairs that he guessed led to the
      private supper-rooms. On his left was the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swept and garnished after the revels of the night previous, and as though
      resting in preparation for those to come, it an air of peaceful
      inactivity. At a table a maitre d&rsquo;ho&rsquo;tel was composing the menu for the
      evening, against the walls three colored waiters lounged sleepily, and on
      a platform at a piano a pale youth with drugged eyes was with one hand
      picking an accompaniment. As Wharton paused uncertainly the young man,
      disdaining his audience, in a shrill, nasal tenor raised his voice and
      sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And from the time the rooster calls
		     I&rsquo;ll wear my overalls,
      And you, a simple gingham gown.
         So, if you&rsquo;re strong for a shower of rice,
      We two could make a paradise Of any One-Horse Town.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At sight of Wharton the head waiter reluctantly detached himself from his
      menu and rose. But before he could greet the visitor, Wharton heard his
      name spoken and, looking up, saw a woman descending the stairs. It was
      apparent that when young she had been beautiful, and, in spite of an
      expression in her eyes of hardness and distrust, which seemed habitual,
      she was still handsome. She was without a hat and wearing a house dress of
      decorous shades and in the extreme of fashion. Her black hair, built up in
      artificial waves, was heavy with brilliantine; her hands, covered deep
      with rings, and of an unnatural white, showed the most fastidious care.
      But her complexion was her own; and her skin, free from paint and powder,
      glowed with that healthy pink that is supposed to be the perquisite only
      of the simple life and a conscience undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mrs. Earle,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I wrote you that note. Will you please
      come this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That she did not suppose he might not come that way was obvious, for, as
      she spoke, she turned her back on him and mounted the stairs. After an
      instant of hesitation, Wharton followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as his mind, his body was now acutely alive and vigilant. Both
      physically and mentally he moved on tiptoe. For whatever surprise, for
      whatever ambush might lie in wait, he was prepared. At the top of the
      stairs he found a wide hall along which on both sides were many doors. The
      one directly facing the stairs stood open. At one side of this the woman
      halted and with a gesture of the jewelled fingers invited him to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sitting-room,&rdquo; she said. As Wharton remained motionless she
      substituted: &ldquo;My office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peering into the room, Wharton found it suited to both titles. He saw
      comfortable chairs, vases filled with autumn leaves, in silver frames
      photographs, and between two open windows a business-like roller-top desk
      on which was a hand telephone. In plain sight through the windows he
      beheld the garage and behind it the tops of trees. To summon Rumson, to
      keep in touch with Nolan, he need only step to one of these windows and
      beckon. The strategic position of the room appealed, and with a bow of the
      head he passed in front of his hostess and entered it. He continued to
      take note of his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now saw that from the office in which he stood doors led to rooms
      adjoining. These doors were shut, and he determined swiftly that before
      the interview began he first must know what lay behind them. Mrs. Earle
      had followed and, as she entered, closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time he had spoken. For an instant the woman hesitated,
      regarding him thoughtfully, and then without resentment pulled the door
      open. She came toward him swiftly, and he was conscious of the rustle of
      silk and the stirring of perfumes. At the open door she cast a frown of
      disapproval and then, with her face close to his, spoke hurriedly in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man brought a girl here to lunch,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been here before.
      The girl claims the man told her he was going to marry her. Last night she
      found out he has a wife already, and she came here to-day meaning to make
      trouble. She brought a gun. They were in the room at the far end of the
      hall. George, the water, heard the two shots and ran down here to get me.
      No one else heard. These rooms are fixed to keep out noise, and the piano
      was going. We broke in and found them on the floor. The man was shot
      through the shoulder, the girl through the body. His story is that after
      she fired, in trying to get the gun from her, she shot herself-by
      accident. That&rsquo;s right, I guess. But the girl says they came here to die
      together&mdash;what the newspaper call a &lsquo;suicide pact&rsquo;&mdash;because they
      couldn&rsquo;t marry, and that he first shot her, intending to kill her and then
      himself. That&rsquo;s silly. She framed it to get him. She missed him with the
      gun, so now she&rsquo;s trying to get him with this murder charge. I know her.
      If she&rsquo;d been sober she wouldn&rsquo;t have shot him; she&rsquo;d have blackmailed
      him. She&rsquo;s that sort. I know her, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an exclamation the district attorney broke in upon her. &ldquo;And the
      man,&rdquo; he demanded eagerly; &ldquo;was it HE killed Banf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In amazement the woman stared. &ldquo;Certainly NOT!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what HAS this to do with Banf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; Her tone was annoyed, reproachful. &ldquo;That was only to bring you
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His disappointment was so keen that it threatened to exhibit itself in
      anger. Recognizing this, before he spoke Wharton forced himself to pause.
      Then he repeated her words quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman exclaimed impatiently: &ldquo;So you could beat the police to it,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;So you could HUSH IT UP!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surprised laugh of the man was quite real. It bore no resentment or
      pose. He was genuinely amused. Then the dignity of his office, tricked and
      insulted, demanded to be heard. He stared at her coldly; his indignation
      was apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done extremely ill,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You know perfectly well you
      had no right to bring me up here; to drag me into a row in your
      road-house. &lsquo;Hush it up!&rsquo;&rdquo; he exclaimed hotly. This time his laugh was
      contemptuous and threatening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how I&rsquo;ll hush it up!&rdquo; He
      moved quickly to the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; commanded the woman. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; She ran to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he was conscious of the rustle of silk, of the stirring of perfumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the key turn in the lock. It had Come. It was a frame-up. There
      would be a scandal. And to save himself from it they would force him to
      &ldquo;hush up&rdquo; this other one. But, as to the outcome, in no way was he
      concerned. Through the window, standing directly below it, he had seen
      Nolan. In the sunlit yard the chauffeur, his cap on the back of his head,
      his cigarette drooping from his lips, was tossing the remnants of a
      sandwich to a circle of excited hens. He presented a picture of bored
      indolence, of innocent preoccupation. It was almost too well done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assured of a witness for the defense, he greeted the woman with a smile.
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I do it?&rdquo; he taunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran close to him and laid her hands on his arm. Her eyes were fixed
      steadily on his. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;the man who shot that girl-is
      your brother-in-law, Ham Cutler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For what seemed a long time Wharton stood looking down into the eyes of
      the woman, and the eyes never faltered. Later he recalled that in the
      sudden silence many noises disturbed the lazy hush of the Indian-summer
      afternoon: the rush of a motor-car on the Boston Road, the tinkle of the
      piano and the voice of the youth with the drugged eyes singing, &ldquo;And
      you&rsquo;ll wear a simple gingham gown,&rdquo; from the yard below the cluck-cluck of
      the chickens and the cooing of pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought was of his sister and of her children, and of what this
      bomb, hurled from the clouds, would mean to her. He thought of Cutler, at
      the height of his power and usefulness, by this one disreputable act
      dragged into the mire, of what disaster it might bring to the party, to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, as the woman invited, he helped to &ldquo;hush it up,&rdquo; and Tammany learned
      the truth, it would make short work of him. It would say, for the murderer
      of Banf he had one law and for the rich brother-in-law, who had tried to
      kill the girl he deceived, another. But before he gave voice to his
      thoughts he recognized them as springing only from panic. They were of a
      part with the acts of men driven by sudden fear, and of which acts in
      their sane moments they would be incapable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of the woman&rsquo;s words had unsettled his traditions. Not only was
      he condemning a man unheard, but a man who, though he might dislike him,
      he had for years, for his private virtues, trusted and admired. The panic
      passed and with a confident smile he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner of the woman was equally calm, equally assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you see her?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather see my brother-in-law,&rdquo; he answered
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman handed him a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Muir took him to his private hospital,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I loaned them
      my car because it&rsquo;s a limousine. The address is on that card. But,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;both your brother and Sammy&mdash;that&rsquo;s Sam Muir, the doctor&mdash;asked
      you wouldn&rsquo;t use the telephone; they&rsquo;re afraid of a leak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Wharton did not hear her. As though it were &ldquo;Exhibit A,&rdquo;
       presented in evidence by the defense, he was studying the card she had
      given him. He stuck it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him at once,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To restrain or dissuade him, the woman made no sudden move. In level tones
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother-in-law asked especially that you wouldn&rsquo;t do that until
      you&rsquo;d fixed it with the girl. Your face is too well known. He&rsquo;s afraid
      some one might find out where he is&mdash;and for a day or two no one must
      know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This doctor knows it,&rdquo; retorted Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion seemed to strike Mrs. Earle as humorous. For the first time
      she laughed. &ldquo;Sammy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lobbygow of mine. He&rsquo;s worked
      for me for years. I could send him up the river if I liked. He knows it.&rdquo;
       Her tone was convincing. &ldquo;They both asked,&rdquo; she continued evenly, &ldquo;you
      should keep off until the girl is out of the country, and fixed.&rdquo; Wharton
      frowned thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, observing this, the eyes of the woman showed that, so far, toward the
      unfortunate incident the attitude of the district attorney was to her most
      gratifying. Wharton ceased frowning. &ldquo;How fixed?&rdquo; he asked. Mrs. Earle
      shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutler&rsquo;s idea is money,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but, believe me, he&rsquo;s wrong. This
      girl is a vampire. She&rsquo;ll only come back to you for more. She&rsquo;ll keep on
      threatening to tell the wife, to tell the papers. The way to fix her is to
      throw a scare into her. And there&rsquo;s only one man can do that; there&rsquo;s only
      one man that can hush this thing up&mdash;that&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I see her?&rdquo; asked Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her.&rdquo; Wharton could not suppress an
      involuntary &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the shade of a second Mrs. Earle exhibited the slightest evidence of
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My room&rsquo;s in a mess,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s not hurt so much as Sammy
      said. He told her she was in bad just to keep her quiet until you got
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Earle opened one of the doors leading from the room. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be a
      minute,&rdquo; she said. Quietly she closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon her disappearance the manner of the district attorney underwent an
      abrupt change. He ran softly to the door opposite the one through which
      Mrs. Earle had passed, and pulled it open. But, if beyond it he expected
      to find an audience of eavesdroppers, he was disappointed. The room was
      empty, and bore no evidence of recent occupation.. He closed the door,
      and, from the roller-top desk, snatching a piece of paper, scribbled upon
      it hastily. Wrapping the paper around a coin, and holding it exposed to
      view, he showed himself at the window. Below him, to an increasing circle
      of hens and pigeons, Nolan was still scattering crumbs. Without
      withdrawing his gaze from them, the chauffeur nodded. Wharton opened his
      hand and the note fell into the yard. Behind him he heard the murmur of
      voices, the sobs of a woman in pain, and the rattle of a door-knob. As
      from the window he turned quickly, he saw that toward the spot where his
      note had fallen Nolan was tossing the last remnants of his sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl who entered with Mrs. Earle, leaning on her and supported by her,
      was tall and fair. Around her shoulders her blond hair hung in disorder,
      and around her waist, under the kimono Mrs. Earle had thrown about her,
      were wrapped many layers of bandages. The girl moved unsteadily and sank
      into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a hostile tone Mrs. Earle addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is the district attorney.&rdquo; To him she added: &ldquo;She
      calls herself Rose Gerard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One hand the girl held close against her side, with the other she brushed
      back the hair from her forehead. From half-closed eyes she stared at
      Wharton defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she challenged, &ldquo;what about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wharton seated himself in front of the roller-top desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you strong enough to tell me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was kind, and this the girl seemed to resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; she sneered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong enough. Strong enough to tell
      all I know&mdash;to you, and to the papers, and to a jury&mdash;until I
      get justice.&rdquo; She clinched her free hand and feebly shook it at him.
      &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S what I&rsquo;m going to get,&rdquo; she cried, her voice breaking
      hysterically, &ldquo;justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From behind the arm-chair in which the girl half-reclined Mrs. Earle
      caught the eye of the district attorney and shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what DID happen?&rdquo; asked Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently with an effort the girl pulled herself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I first met your brother-in-law&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wharton interrupted quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are not talking to me as anybody&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
      but as the district attorney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re ashamed of him!&rdquo; she jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she began: &ldquo;I first met Ham Cutler last May. He wanted to marry me
      then. He told me he was not a married man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As her story unfolded, Wharton did not again interrupt; and speaking
      quickly, in abrupt, broken phrases, the girl brought her narrative to the
      moment when, as she claimed, Cutler had attempted to kill her. At this
      point a knock at the locked door caused both the girl and her audience to
      start. Wharton looked at Mrs. Earle inquiringly, but she shook her head,
      and with a look at him also of inquiry, and of suspicion as well, opened
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      With apologies her head waiter presented a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Mr. Wharton,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;from his chauffeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wharton&rsquo;s annoyance at the interruption was most apparent. &ldquo;What the devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the note rapidly, and with a frown of irritation raised his eyes
      to Mrs. Earle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to go to New Rochelle for an inner tube,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How long
      would it take him to get there and back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hard and distrustful expression upon the face of Mrs. Earle, which was
      habitual, was now most strongly in evidence. Her eyes searched those of
      Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty minutes, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; snapped Wharton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; he directed the waiter, &ldquo;to stay where he is. Tell him I may
      want to go back to the office any minute.&rdquo; He turned eagerly to the girl.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said. With impatience he crumpled the note into a ball and
      glanced about him. At his feet was a waste-paper basket. Fixed upon him he
      saw, while pretending not to see, the eyes of Mrs. Earle burning with
      suspicion. If he destroyed the note, he knew suspicion would become
      certainty. Without an instant of hesitation, carelessly he tossed it
      intact into the waste-paper basket. Toward Rose Gerard he swung the
      revolving chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Please,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had now reached the climax of her story, but the eyes of Mrs.
      Earle betrayed the fact that her thoughts were elsewhere. With an intense
      and hungry longing, they were concentrated upon her own waste-paper
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the girl in anger and defiance recalled Mrs. Earle to the
      business of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried to kill me,&rdquo; shouted Miss Rose. &ldquo;And his shooting himself in the
      shoulder was a bluff. THAT&rsquo;S my story; that&rsquo;s the story I&rsquo;m going to tell
      the judge&rdquo;&mdash;her voice soared shrilly&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the story that&rsquo;s
      going to send your brother-in-law to Sing Sing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Mrs. Earle contributed to the general conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like a fish,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned upon her savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t like the way I talk,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he can come across!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Earle exclaimed in horror. Virtuously her hands were raised in
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like hell he will!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t pull that under my roof!&rdquo;
       Wharton looked disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come across?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come across?&rdquo; mimicked the girl. &ldquo;Send me abroad and keep me there. And
      I&rsquo;ll swear it was an accident. Twenty-five thousand, that&rsquo;s all I want.
      Cutler told me he was going to make you governor. He can&rsquo;t make you
      governor if he&rsquo;s in Sing Sing, can he? Ain&rsquo;t it worth twenty-five thousand
      to you to be governor? Come on,&rdquo; she jeered, &ldquo;kick in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a grave but untroubled voice Wharton addressed Mrs. Earle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I use your telephone?&rdquo; he asked. He did not wait for her consent, but
      from the desk lifted the hand telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring, three one hundred!&rdquo; he said. He sat with his legs comfortably
      crossed, the stand of the instrument balanced on his knee, his eyes gazing
      meditatively at the yellow tree-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      If with apprehension both women started, if the girl thrust herself
      forward, and by the hand of Mrs. Earle was dragged back, he did not appear
      to know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police headquarters?&rdquo; they heard him ask. &ldquo;I want to speak to the
      commissioner. This is the district attorney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the pause that followed, as though to torment her, the pain, in her
      side apparently turned, for the girl screamed sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; commanded the older woman. Breathless, across the top of the
      arm-chair, she was leaning forward. Upon the man at the telephone her eyes
      were fixed in fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commissioner,&rdquo; said the district attorney, &ldquo;this is Wharton speaking. A
      woman has made a charge of attempted murder to me against my
      brother-in-law, Hamilton Cutler. On account of our relationship, I want
      you to make the arrest. If there were any slip, and he got away, it might
      be said I arranged it. You will find him at the Winona apartments on the
      Southern Boulevard, in the private hospital of a Doctor Samuel Muir.
      Arrest them both. The girl who makes the charge is at Kessler&rsquo;s Cafe, on
      the Boston Post Road, just inside the city line. Arrest her too. She tried
      to blackmail me. I&rsquo;ll appear against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wharton rose and addressed himself to Mrs. Earle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I had to do it. You might have known I could
      not hush it up. I am the only man who can&rsquo;t hush it up. The people of New
      York elected me to enforce the laws.&rdquo; Wharton&rsquo;s voice was raised to a loud
      pitch. It seemed unnecessarily loud. It was almost as though he were
      addressing another and more distant audience. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued, his
      voice still soaring, &ldquo;even if my own family suffer, even if I suffer, even
      if I lose political promotion, those laws I will enforce!&rdquo; In the more
      conventional tone of every-day politeness, he added: &ldquo;May I speak to you
      outside, Mrs. Earle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, as in silence that lady descended the stairs, the district attorney
      seemed to have forgotten what it was he wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he had seen his chauffeur arouse himself from apparently
      deep slumber and crank the car that he addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had better go back to bed. My men are all around
      this house and, until the police come, will detain her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook the jewelled fingers of Mrs. Earle warmly. &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;I know you meant well. I know you wanted to help me, but&rdquo;&mdash;he
      shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;my duty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he walked down the driveway to his car his shoulders continued to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Earle did not wait to observe this phenomenon. Rid of his
      presence, she leaped, rather than ran, up the stairs and threw open the
      door of her office.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she entered, two men followed her. One was a young man who held in his
      hand an open note-book, the other was Tim Meehan, of Tammany. The latter
      greeted her with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard everything he said,&rdquo; he cried. His voice rose in torment. &ldquo;An&rsquo; 
      we can&rsquo;t use a word of it! He acted just like we&rsquo;d oughta knowed he&rsquo;d act.
      He&rsquo;s HONEST! He&rsquo;s so damned honest he ain&rsquo;t human; he&rsquo;s a&mdash;gilded
      saint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Earle did not heed him. On her knees she was tossing to the floor the
      contents of the waste-paper basket. From them she snatched a piece of
      crumpled paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Listen! His chauffeur brought him this.&rdquo; In a
      voice that quivered with indignation, that sobbed with anger, she read
      aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As directed by your note from the window, I went to the booth and called
      up Mrs. Cutler&rsquo;s house and got herself on the phone. Your brother-in-law
      lunched at home to-day with her and the children and they are now going to
      the Hippodrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, look, and listen! Back of the bar I see two men in a room, but they
      did not see me. One is Tim Meehan, the other is a stenographer. He is
      taking notes. Each of them has on the ear-muffs of a dictagraph. Looks
      like you&rsquo;d better watch your step and not say nothing you don&rsquo;t want
      Tammany to print.&rsquo;&rdquo; The voice of Mrs. Earle rose in a shrill shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him&mdash;a gilded saint?&rdquo; she screamed; &ldquo;you big stiff! He knew he was
      talking into a dictagraph all the time, and he double-crossed us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
